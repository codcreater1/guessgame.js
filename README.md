Guess the Number Game
Description
This is a simple "Guess the Number" game built with JavaScript. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback, telling the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

This project is my first JavaScript project, and it's a great introduction to JavaScript's basic features such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
